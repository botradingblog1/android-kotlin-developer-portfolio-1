# Developer Portfolio 

## Overview
This project is a native Android app written in Kotlin. The purpose is to showcase a mobile developer's app portfolio. 

This project uses a master-detail layout for tablet devices and a single-column layout for phone devices. The app is best viewed on tablets.

This is my personal developer portfolio project. If you would like to use this project to create your own developer portfolio, please use my other repository 'android-kotlin-developer-portfolio-1'.
